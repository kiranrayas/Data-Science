2013,Post-Route Alleviation of Dense Meander Segments in High-Performance Printed Circuit Boards,ICCAD '13,Tsun-Ming Tseng;; Bing Li;; Tsung-Yi Ho;; Ulf Schlichtmann,Length-matching is an important technique to balance delays of bus signals in high-performance PCB routing. Existing routers;; however;; may generate dense meander segments with small distance. Signals propagating across these meander segments exhibit a speedup effect due to crosstalks between the segments of the same wire;; thus leading to mismatch of arrival times even with the same physical wire length. In this paper;; we propose a post-processing method to enlarge the width and the distance of meander segments and distribute them more evenly on the board so that the crosstalks can be reduced. In the proposed framework;; we model the sharing combinations of available routing areas after removing dense meander segments from the initial routing;; as well as the generation of relaxed meander segments and their groups in subareas. Thereafter;; this model is transformed into an ILP problem and solved efficiently. Experimental results show that the proposed method can extend the width and the distance of meander segments about two times even under very tight area constraints;; so that the crosstalks and thus the speedup effect can be alleviated effectively in high-performance PCB designs.,,,,
???,pqsfinder web: G-quadruplex prediction using optimized pqsfinder algorithm,BIOINFORMATICS,Labudova;; Dominika; Hon;; Jiri; Lexa;; Matej,Motivation: G-quadruplex is a DNA or RNA form in which four guanine-rich regions are held together by base pairing between guanine nucleotides in coordination with potassium ions. G-quadruplexes are increasingly seen as a biologically important component of genomes. Their detection in vivo is problematic; however;; sequencing and spectrometric techniques exist for their in vitro detection. We previously devised the pqsfinder algorithm for PQS identification;; implemented it in C++ and published as an R/Bioconductor package. We looked for ways to optimize pqsfinder for faster and user-friendly sequence analysis. Results: We identified two weak points where pqsfinder could be optimized. We modified the internals of the recursive algorithm to avoid matching and scoring many sub-optimal PQS conformations that are later discarded. To accommodate the needs of a broader range of users;; we created a website for submission of sequence analysis jobs that does not require knowledge of R to use pqsfinder.,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btz928,,

2017,Precise Detection of Side-Channel Vulnerabilities Using Quantitative Cartesian Hoare Logic,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,Jia Chen;; Yu Feng;; Isil Dillig,This paper presents Themis;; an end-to-end static analysis tool for finding resource-usage side-channel vulnerabilities in Java applications. We introduce the notion of epsilon-bounded non-interference;; a variant and relaxation of Goguen and Meseguer's well-known non-interference principle. We then present Quantitative Cartesian Hoare Logic (QCHL);; a program logic for verifying epsilon-bounded non-interference. Our tool;; Themis;; combines automated reasoning in CHL with lightweight static taint analysis to improve scalability. We evaluate Themis on well known Java applications and demonstrate that Themis can find unknown side-channel vulnerabilities in widely-used programs. We also show that Themis can verify the absence of vulnerabilities in repaired versions of vulnerable programs and that Themis compares favorably against Blazer;; a state-of-the-art static analysis tool for finding timing side channels in Java applications.,,,,

2015,Visualizing Loops and Data Structures in Xylem: The Code of Plants,Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Games and Software Engineering,Heather Logas;; Richard Vallejos;; Joseph Osborn;; Kate Compton;; Jim Whitehead,The visual representation of software data structures is especially relevant to the creation of games which crowdsource science problems to a gaming community and to educational games which seek to teach computer science concepts within the context of computer games. Xylem: The Code of Plants is a game designed to crowdsource formal software verification via loop invariant specifications. Due to the nature of this project;; it was important that the game 1) appeal to a large audience;; 2) support a wide variety of data structures and 3) hide any actual data from the source code that was generating the game levels. To these ends;; a method of visualizing data structures was developed that features a consistent plant-based narrative metaphor;; is flexible enough to accommodate multiple types of data structures while maintaining narrative integrity;; and obscures all real data from the target source code.,loop invariants;; software verification games;; data structure visualization;; games and software engineering;; program visualization;; formal verification,,,
2012,Visualizing the Protein Sequence Universe,ECMLS '12,Larissa Stanberry;; Roger Higdon;; Winston Haynes;; Natali Kolker;; William Broomall;; Saliya Ekanayake;; Adam Hughes;; Yang Ruan;; Judy Qiu;; Eugene Kolker;; Geoffrey Fox,Modern biology is experiencing a rapid increase in data volumes that challenges our analytical skills and existing cyberinfrastructure. Exponential expansion of the Protein Sequence Universe (PSU);; the protein sequence space;; together with the costs and complexities of manual curation creates a major bottleneck in life sciences research. Existing resources lack scalable visualization tools that are instrumental for functional annotation. Here;; we describe a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) implementation to create a 3D embedding of the PSU that allows visualizing the relationships between large numbers of proteins. To demonstrate the method;; we use sequence similarity scores as a measure of proximity. An example of the prokaryotic PSU shows that the low-dimensional representation preserves important grouping features such as relative proximity of functionally similar clusters and clear structural separation between clusters with specific and general functions. The advantages of the method and its implementation include the ability to scale to large numbers of sequences;; integrate different similarity measures with other functional and experimental data;; and facilitate protein annotation. Transdisciplinary approaches akin to the one described in this paper are urgently needed to quickly and efficiently translate the influx of new data into tangible innovations and groundbreaking discoveries.,multidimensional scaling;; computational bioinformatics;; uniprot;; data visualization;; uniref;; hive;; sequence similarity;; mapreduce;; psu;; twister;; blast;; cog;; sammon;; protein sequence universe;; em;; azure;; protein annotation;; needleman-wunsch;; data-enabled life sciences;; mpi;; hadoop;; delsa,10.1145/2483954.2483958,,
2013,Wellfounded Recursion with Copatterns: A Unified Approach to Termination and Productivity,Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming,Andreas M. Abel;; Brigitte Pientka,In this paper;; we study strong normalization of a core language based on System F-omega which supports programming with finite and infinite structures. Building on our prior work;; finite data such as finite lists and trees are defined via constructors and manipulated via pattern matching;; while infinite data such as streams and infinite trees is defined by observations and synthesized via copattern matching. In this work;; we take a type-based approach to strong normalization by tracking size information about finite and infinite data in the type. This guarantees compositionality. More importantly;; the duality of pattern and copatterns provide a unifying semantic concept which allows us for the first time to elegantly and uniformly support both well-founded induction and coinduction by mere rewriting. The strong normalization proof is structured around Girard's reducibility candidates. As such our system allows for non-determinism and does not rely on coverage. Since System F-omega is general enough that it can be the target of compilation for the Calculus of Constructions;; this work is a significant step towards representing observation-centric infinite data in proof assistants such as Coq and Agda.,,,,

1980,Workshop on Formal Verification: (VERkshop),SIGSOFT Softw. Eng. Notes,no author,There has been significant progress in the formal verification of system designs and of programs in the last few years;; but there are many problems remaining. In an effort to assess the state of the art on the practical side of formal verification;; a workshop (VERkshop) was held in April at SRI;; co-organized by Peter Neumann and Steve Walker (DoD). There were about 50 attendees;; essentially all of whom contributed on-line informal written statements (research summaries;; position statements;; etc.) in advance.In order to share the conclusions of the VERkshop with a wider audience;; we are including most of the a priori VERkshop contribution in this issue (although some have been abridged). In addition;; a posteriori statements are included that summarize the three days' activities. Some trivial corrections and formatting have been added;; but otherwise the material is essentially as received. The included items have page numbers as indicated.,,10.1145/1005913.1005914,,

2020,Zero-Shot Image Classification via Consistent Subspace Learning,CNIOT2020,Shiwei Chen;; Hongyun Zhang,Recent years have witnessed great advances in image classification due to the availability of high-volume data and the development of deep neural networks. Nevertheless;; the classification performance strongly depends on abundant training samples for the specific category;; and there is no ability to recognize categories that do not appear during the training process. In this paper;; a novel formulation based on consistent subspace learning for zero-shot image classification is proposed;; which pursues a common subspace of the visual features and semantic representations of images. Particularly;; such a subspace is defined by class label information;; in which a similarity metric is utilized for the zero-shot image classification. In addition;; a novel mechanism is developed to efficiently capture the consistent information between visual and semantic embeddings in the learned subspace. An iterative optimization algorithm based on block coordinate descent is designed to solve the proposed formulation. Ultimately;; comprehensive experimental analyses on five public datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm gains promising performance;; and even outperforms several state-of-the-art works.,Block Coordinate Descent;; Zero-shot Classification;; Subspace Learning,10.1145/3398329.3398353,,
